# PZModFix
A cmd file that automatically deletes and copies the mod folders from Project Zomboid ("Workshop item version is different than serverâ€™s")

# How to use
- Put your Steam directory into the path.txt file (default is : C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam)
- follow the instructions in the program:
  - check the directory
  - confirm the prozess of deleting the folders and files (2 times, for Steams and for Project Zomboids Workshop folders)
  - restart Steam, unsubscribe from all mods you use, resubscribe to them (easier done if added to collection)
  - let the program copy the folder and file from Steams to Project Zomboids Workshop folder
  - start your locally hosted Project Zomboid server and see if it worked
